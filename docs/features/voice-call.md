# Voice call

A hands-free call with one bot from the iPhone chat (the waveform button in an empty composer).
The bot is the same agent on the computer; the call only changes how you talk to it.

## Implemented: on the phone

- `kit/Sources/CodyncUI/Call/`: `CallSession` (audio loop) + `CallView` (the call bar).
- UI follows Grok Bot: a floating capsule over the top of the chat (`ThreadView` overlay), and the
  chat stays readable and usable underneath. Left to right: the bot's avatar (pulses while
  speaking; tap it to interrupt), a dotted level line (your voice while listening, a ripple while
  the bot speaks, a slow breath while it works), gear (call settings), mic (mute), red ✕ (end).
- Speech → text with `SFSpeechRecognizer` (on-device when the language supports it). A pause ends an
  utterance and sends it as an ordinary message (`BotStore.send`), so it takes the normal path:
  queued while the bot works, folded into its next turn. What you said appears in the chat as your
  message; the bot's reply appears as its message.
- Each new final reply (`data.final`) is read aloud with `AVSpeechSynthesizer` in the reply's own
  language; markdown and code blocks are dropped (`SpokenText`). The mic pauses while it speaks.
  An approval request is announced, answered in the chat.
- Gear: pause length before sending (1 / 1.5 / 2.5 s) and reading speed; kept on the phone.
- Ending the call calls `logCall {botId, seconds}`; the host adds a notice (`callSeconds`) that
  every client shows as "Voice chat · 00:16".
- The host receives recognized text; the Cloudflare transport sees encrypted channel frames.
  Sidekicks does not forward microphone audio to the host. Speech recognition may use Apple services
  when on-device recognition is unavailable. `UIBackgroundModes: audio` permits
  background microphone capture and speech playback during an active call.
- While a call is listening or speaking, it retains the computer's transport across
  foreground/background transitions. Ending or failing the last call releases that
  connection when backgrounded, restoring normal push delivery. Removing the computer
  or switching accounts ends its calls and closes the transport.
- Final replies and approval notices are delivered from the store's incoming events
  directly to the audio session, rather than waiting for a SwiftUI view update.
  Replayed final replies, other bots and thread replies are not read into this call.

## Background verification

Store regression tests cover sending a recognized utterance after backgrounding,
delivering a final reply without view updates, returning to the foreground without
restarting an active call's connection, ending the last call, and retiring the
store. They do not simulate iOS audio or background scheduling.

On a physical iPhone, start a voice call with a connected bot, return to the Home
Screen, then speak a request. Verify that it sends successfully and the reply is
read aloud while Sidekicks remains backgrounded. Also start a long reply in Sidekicks,
return Home during playback, and verify that speech continues. End the call and
confirm that ordinary background notification behavior resumes. For App Review,
the recording must capture both the physical device and the audible reply.

## App Review recording

The 2.2.1 (22) review requested a screen recording on a **physical device** for
Guideline 2.5.4. Record these steps using a connected computer and a bot:

1. Open its conversation and tap the waveform button with an empty composer.
2. Allow microphone and Speech Recognition access. Speak a short request and
   show the recognized message and the bot's spoken reply.
3. While a long reply is being read, return to the Home Screen. Keep recording
   long enough to demonstrate audible playback continuing in the background.
4. Return to Sidekicks and end the call.

Ensure the resulting file contains the audible reply. If the screen recorder
cannot capture the call audio, record the physical phone externally with another
device so both its screen and speaker are audible. Include the recording and
these navigation steps in App Review Information for future submissions.

Simulator recordings are useful for UI checks but are not the physical-device
evidence Apple requested. A `simctl io ... recordVideo` probe on 2026-09-30
produced an H.264 video track with no audio track. Transport regression tests
verify background reply delivery and retirement, not iOS audio behavior.

## Design: realtime voice with your own key (not implemented)

Better recognition (mixed Chinese/English, code terms) and a real conversation (barge-in, "what are
you doing?" answered from the transcript) need a realtime speech model. Users bring their own
provider key; Sidekicks never resells minutes for it.

### Engines

The gear's first section becomes **Voice engine**:

| Engine | Needs | Transport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On device (default) | nothing | what ships today |
| OpenAI Realtime | OpenAI API key | WebRTC, phone ↔ OpenAI |
| Gemini Live | Google AI Studio key | WebSocket, phone ↔ Google |

Picking a cloud engine without a key opens its key form: a secure field, a link to the provider's
key page, **Test** (one cheap authenticated call; shows "Key works" or the provider's error), and a
voice picker. The call bar shows the provider's small wordmark-free label ("OpenAI") next to the
dots whenever audio leaves the phone.

### Where the key lives

- On the iPhone only, in the Keychain (`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`, not
  synced). It is never sent to the host, the relay or our cloud, and never written to logs.
- The long-lived key is used for one thing: minting a short-lived client credential at call start
  (OpenAI `POST /v1/realtime/client_secrets`, Gemini ephemeral auth tokens). The audio session only
  ever sees that credential.
- Rejected: key on the host with audio proxied through it. Audio would cross the encrypted channel
  and the relay (latency, relay bandwidth), and a Linux server host has no microphone reason to
  hold it.

### How the call works

The realtime model is an operator in front of the bot, not a replacement for it:

- Session instructions: who the bot is (name, description), that coding is done by the bot, reply
  in the user's language, keep spoken answers short.
- Tools the phone implements locally against `BotStore`: `send_to_bot(text)` (an ordinary message,
  same path as today), `bot_status()` (idle/working, activity line, pending approval),
  `recent_messages(count)` (chat-visible entries only), `answer_approval(option)` (only after the
  user said which).
- Each new final reply is pushed into the realtime conversation as a context item; the model speaks
  it (shortened for speech). Barge-in is the provider's own voice activity detection.
- The chat stays the record: only `send_to_bot` messages and the bot's replies are entries. The
  operator's small talk isn't saved; the call still ends with the "Voice chat" notice.

### Failure and cost

- Invalid key, quota or network failure at start → the call falls back to On device with a one-line
  notice under the bar; mid-call failure does the same without dropping the call.
- Usage is billed by the provider to the user. The gear shows minutes used this month (counted on
  the phone) next to the engine, as an estimate, not a bill.

### Code layout

- `kit/Sources/CodyncUI/Call/VoiceEngine.swift`: `protocol VoiceEngine` (start, end, mute,
  interrupt, `phase`, `level`, `onUserMessage`, `speak(reply:)`); `OnDeviceEngine` is today's
  `CallSession`; `OpenAIRealtimeEngine` (WebRTC, the app already links WebRTC for Remote screen)
  and `GeminiLiveEngine` (URLSessionWebSocketTask).
- `kit/Sources/CodyncKit/Client/VoiceKeys.swift`: Keychain storage + credential minting.
- `CallView` only talks to `VoiceEngine`; nothing on the host changes.
- A later Sidekicks Pro plan can add a second credential source (our server mints the client token after
  checking the entitlement) behind the same engines.
